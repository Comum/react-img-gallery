# React img gallery

React image gallery is a react component taht receives a list of images and creates a scrollable area around the images.

This package was built from a fork of https://github.com/ovieokeh/npm-react-typescript-template.

## Developing commands

- `npm run build` - compile the code
- `npm run start` - compile the code and refresh on file change

## How to use

Import the package:

```import Slider from "react-img-gallery-by-comum";```

The slider component needs a string array with the images urls and an optional flag to disable the infinte scroll. If the array is empty, nothing is rendered.
